<section><div class="container">
<details class="faq-item"><summary>What age should I start thinking about testosterone levels?</summary><p>Testosterone begins declining around age 30 at a rate of about 1% per year. We recommend baseline testing at 30-35 and monitoring from there. However, symptoms of Low T can occur at any age — if you're experiencing fatigue, low libido, or mood changes, testing is appropriate regardless of age.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Testosterone Replacement Therapy safe?</summary><p>When properly prescribed and monitored by experienced medical professionals, TRT has an excellent safety profile. We conduct regular bloodwork to monitor your levels, red blood cell count, PSA, and other markers. Our protocols are evidence-based and adjusted to your individual response.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>How quickly will I see results from TRT?</summary><p>Most men notice improvements in energy and mood within 3-6 weeks. Libido and sexual function improvements typically come within 4-8 weeks. Body composition changes (more muscle, less fat) develop over 3-6 months. Maximum benefits are usually seen at 6-12 months.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you treat erectile dysfunction without medication?</summary><p>Yes. While oral medications are effective for many men, we also address underlying causes — hormonal imbalances, cardiovascular issues, metabolic dysfunction, and lifestyle factors. Many men see significant improvement through hormone optimization and lifestyle changes alone.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>What does the initial consultation include?</summary><p>Your first visit includes a thorough health history review, discussion of your symptoms and goals, comprehensive bloodwork panel, physical examination, and a preliminary treatment plan. We take the time to understand your complete picture before recommending any treatment.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you accept insurance?</summary><p>We work with most major insurance carriers. Contact our office for specific coverage questions and we'll help you understand your benefits.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>How often will I need to come in for appointments?</summary><p>After your initial consultation and treatment start, follow-up visits are typically every 4-8 weeks during the optimization phase, then every 3-6 months once your levels are stable. Bloodwork frequency depends on your treatment protocol.</p></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Is everything confidential?</summary><p>Absolutely. All consultations, records, and treatments are completely confidential, protected by HIPAA regulations. We understand the sensitive nature of men's health concerns and maintain the highest standards of privacy.</p></details>
